## Last Week's Accomplishments

Added documentation and comments to scheduler crate and published crate docs to GitHub pages.

## This Week's Plan

Make a webservice crate and integrate with shceduler crate. 
Perhaps write some unit tests.

## Anything Blocking?

I need to actually learn what a REST API is.
