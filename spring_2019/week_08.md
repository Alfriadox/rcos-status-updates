## Last Week's Accomplishments

Not much to be honest. I can't really figure out how to write the algorithm in a
idomatic and correct way without introducing a signifigant amount of overhead.

## This Week's Plan

Try to figure out the proper solver algorithm and implement it.

## Anything Blocking?

Just the complexity of the the problem.
