## Last Week's Accomplishments

Worked on more of scheduler. Just trying to get a working model right now, without worrying
about optimization/speed.

## This Week's Plan

Hopefully finish a prototype of the scheduler.

## Anything Blocking?

The complexity of the problem, and just being busy at the end of the semester (exams this week).
