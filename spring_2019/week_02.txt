## Last Week's Accomplishments

Reviewed rust web service crates, identified some possible candidates for 
yacs:
- actix-web,
- rouille,
- iron

Also reviewed scheduler crate. Need to do docs and comments and stuff for it.

## This Week's Plan

Add documentation and comments to scheduler crate and published crate docs 
to GitHub pages.
Maybe write some unit tests.

## Anything Blocking?

None.
