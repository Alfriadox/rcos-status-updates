## Last Week's Accomplishments

To be honest I have not done much on YACS this week. 
I've been continuing work on the scheduler backend with Albert from the NYU Team.

## This Week's Plan

Hopefully get the schedule solver figured out.

## Anything Blocking?

Disagreements about algorithm and data structures being used.
