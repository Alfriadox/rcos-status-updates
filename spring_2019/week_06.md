## Last Week's Accomplishments

Talked a bunch with Albert Liu from the NYU team about the math and model of the schedule solver.

## This Week's Plan

Work on merging Albert Liu's PR and in theory, implementing a more efficient solver.

## Anything Blocking?

Albert has some very strong opinions about how things should be done that sometimes differ from mine.
Talking these over and sorting them out will take time.
