## Last Week's Accomplishments

Joined YACS for a second semester. 

## This Week's Plan

Work on putting the Rust Scheduler from last semester in a container, 
and integrating with the YACS stack.

## Anything Blocking?

Not much. I don't know what library I will use, but I suspect any of them 
will work. I had been looking at using iron, however actix-web seems faster.
The only issue might be getting the container to launch from the YACS stack.

## Notes

None.
