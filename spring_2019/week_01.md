## Last Week's Accomplishments

Joined YACS for a second semester. 

## This Week's Plan

Work on putting the Rust Scheduler from last semester in a container, and integrating with the YACS stack.

## Anything Blocking?

Not much. I know what libraries I'm going to use.
The only issue might be getting the container to launch from the YACS stack.

## Notes

None.
