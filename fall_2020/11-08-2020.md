### This Week

A lot of work was done this week. I mapped out my plans for the rest of the semester in a GitHub issue and wrote and debugged a significant portion of the confirmations system. I made a utility function to handle blocking asynchronous errors and refactored parts of the existing code to use it. I wrote templates for the html and plaintext versions of the confirmation emails and wrote the associated backend structures and methods to support their creation. I imported the rcos branding assets as a git submodule so I could serve them statically. I updated several dependencies and got dependabot working on the GitHub repo.

### Next Week

I intend to finish as much of the project as I can and make the call to deploy a beta or postpone deployment. This is going to be a lot of work. Most of it is detailed in the roadmap, but the major features that still need to be finished are the attendance system, parts of the email confirmation and password recovery system, and parts of the project system.
