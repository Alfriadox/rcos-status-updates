## Nia Calia-Bogan -- Telescope -- 2020.12.06 -- caliaa2

### This Week

This week I worked on refactoring the templating system to add flexibility. Previously the templates all corresponded directly to rust structures. This would often increase the amount of annoying boilerplate code that had to be written to support conversion from the rust structure to the JSON string passed to handlebars. After the refactor, there is one type to represent templates that stores the JSON and template path directly. This allows adding/removing/retyping fields in the JSON object without creating a new rust type to represent the output.

### Next Week

I have to give my presentation on a deep dive into telescopeâ€™s architecture, and possibly deploy telescope. While not working on either of those two things I have to finish this refactor and get back to work on the password recovery system and user settings page.
