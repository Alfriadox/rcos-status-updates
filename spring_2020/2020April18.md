## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I reviewed and merged in two pull requests. 

The first was a block expression parser I wrote. 
After a code review from Ben Levy, I made the requested changes to my code, and merged the request.

The second was a scoped name parser written by Thalia Nero. I reviewed the changes, and then added an additional testcase to the pull request before merging.

## This Week's Plan
This week I hope to finally merge the Binary expression parser. This is a particularly complicated feature, as binary expressions are hard to parse. 
We have gone through several different attempts at doing this, and are currently working on a Shunting Yard algorithm to solve it.

## Anything Blocking?
