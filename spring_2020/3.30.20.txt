This week, I worked on transitioning the group online due to COVID-19.
I also Committed and merged a bunch of features (Conditional parser, skeleton code for Block parser, expression parsing) in PR #30. 
I also reviewed and merged several other branches from team members.

Next week I intend to work on and merge multiline comment parsing, pattern parsing, and parts of Binary operator parsing.

Possible roadblock include the difficulty of parsing binary expressions and things like that, and whether to use a precedence climbing
algorithm or a shunting yard algorithm.
