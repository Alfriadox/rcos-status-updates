## Last week's accomplishments
Did mostly a bunch of grading.
Also managed to do a code review and merge in the refactor branch,
which should improve parsing times and efficiency. Also makes code
more readable.

## Goals for this week
Working on merging in a gitattributes file to force consistient newline
characters across the project. This would be good, as we recently picked up
someone who is developing on windows. Our current work around is through a rustfmt
config that will automatically convert all of them during code formatting.
I also plan to do more grading.

## Any blockers?
I do not know how gitattributes works and the documentation online
is not super helpful. Similary stack overflow is more confusing than anything,
so it is hard to figure out how to configure gitattributes.
