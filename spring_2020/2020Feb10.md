## Last week's accomplishments

Last week I introduced my project, Wright, to RCOS.
I received and began reviewing my first pull request from a member of the
project, implementing a binary expression parser, and also helped compile some
resources for my team members to learn rust.

## Goals for this week
Finalize and merge the Binary expression parser and write and submit the project
proposal. Perhaps also implement other parser features if time allows. Prioritize
features based on github issues.

## Any blockers?
None so far.
