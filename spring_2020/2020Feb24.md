## Last week's accomplishments

Last week I merged parentheses parsing, binary expression parsing, and wrote and merged a utility function which should fix a bug 
where we call every parser twice, once to recognize, and once to extract and construct values. I also wrote and merged a test for 
the utility function, and merged in tests for the other parsers.

## Goals for this week
Figure out, implement, and merge in single and multiline comment parsing.

## Any blockers?
None
