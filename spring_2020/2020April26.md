## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week a made a bunch of progress on the AST evaluator and the 
modules that are all needed for that. I also reviewed and merged
a branch that implemented function call expression parsing. 
I made some progress on a much needed refactor of the AST module,
but that branch and its pull request was destroyed when I was 
experimenting with git filter-branch commands to try to remove a
large file from the git history. 

## This Week's Plan
Luckily I saved a copy of most of my changes to the AST so hopefully
those will be easy to revive, and then I will create a PR to get those
merged. I also plan to continue work on the AST evaluator, and begin work
on the Type parser, which the evaluator will depend upon.
I also intend to revise my amendments to the binary expression pull request,
then review and merge that. 

## Anything Blocking?
Lots of finals around this time, and most of the team is sorta winding down
since our final presentation was two weeks ago and there isn't really time 
to start on new features at this point, since there is only one week left.
