## Last week's accomplishments

Last week I made more tracking issuse for features that need to be implemented in the 
wright parser. I made a branch for one of these issuse (parentheses parsing) and implemented 
it. I have yet to merge it into master. I also worked on reviewing ben's pull request. 

## Goals for this week
Merge parens and binary expression paring into master. 

## Any blockers?
None
