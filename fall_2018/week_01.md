## Last Week's Accomplishments

I went through most of the Angular Tutorial, however it was rather confusing to be honest, and I hope not to deal with Angular ever again.
During our YACS meeting, I selected 2 accessibility bugs to work on over the next week.

## This Week's Plan

I will be fixing the two selected accessibility bugs.
I also talked to Ada and will be working on rewriting the core scheduling functionality in rust, using Rocket, Serde, and a few other crates.

## Anything Blocking?
