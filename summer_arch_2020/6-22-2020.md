Telescope Week 2

## This Week
This week I finished the login modal and began the sponsors page, auth service, and database integration.
We are using postgres for our database and diesel for our ORM / Query builder. 

## Next Week
I hope to finish the database integration and authentication service. 
I would also like to finish the sponsors page (since it's static) but I am not sure I will be able to 
given that the database and authentication service are both large tasks.

## Blockers
Continuous issues with building the project resolved by installing libpq-dev it seems. This definitely caused me delays though.
