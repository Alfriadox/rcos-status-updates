Telescope Week 7

## This Week

This week I made a lot of progress. I've added a 2 new tables to the database; One to store email confirmations and another to store password recovery info. I've also converted the entire project from W3.CSS to Bootstrap and ported over some of the static pages from Patrick's branch. I also added a new library to send emails to users.

## Next Week

I am working on getting all of the frontend components to talk to the backend and then I will move on to the Projects and Developers pages. For this to happen, I need to be able to create and sign into an account first so I willl focus on those thing first. 

## Blockers

None.
