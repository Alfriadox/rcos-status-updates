Telescope Week 4

## This Week

This week I worked on debugging/fixing the database connection, using the example from the actix-web examples repository [here](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/diesel/). I added a number of items to the readme to help users debug database issues in the future. Hopefully once all the type related errors in the code are resolved, this will build and run smoothly (however as of now I am not getting a working build on the database branch).

## Next Week

I would like to finish fixing the database connection issues and finish the authentication system and features that are waiting on that. If there is time, I would like to get started on the administative tools and admin page, but that's optimistic.

## Blockers

Issues building the project due to the complexity of setting up diesel as an ORM, and ambiguity related to the example code I'm attempting to follow. Most of this ambiguity should have been resolved in [this github issue](https://github.com/actix/examples/issues/337).
