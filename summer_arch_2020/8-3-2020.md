Telescope Week 7

## This Week

This week I continued debugging and fixing issues with Diesel. It seems that the CLI application used to control diesel and run migrations does not update schema.rs properly. I added a section to the readme that shows how to update the schema file and run the migrations properly. This has been a huge time sink for me lately. Hopefully this is the last fix I'll need to make.

I also streamlined the Static Page rendering system, which slimmed down the codebase a bit. Static pages now expose a handler directly to the router, rather than being placed behind a service.

## Next Week

I would like to finish integrating diesel into at least one part of the project. (Preferably get user authentication and login working.) If I have extra time, it would be good to work on the project page and user pages. This is the same goal I had last week, but now that diesel is fixed, this should be more feasible. 

## Blockers

Diesel is a pain and I'm tempted to not use an ORM or query builder at all at this point.
