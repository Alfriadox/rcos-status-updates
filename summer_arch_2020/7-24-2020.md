Telescope Week 6

## This Week

This week I finished connecting the database to the web application. I also added public API support using GraphQL via the rust crate [juniper](https://crates.io/crates/juniper). I continued pulling pieces of code from the [diesel actix-web example](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/diesel/). I also used and adapted code from the [advanced juniper example](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/juniper-advanced). We support a (currently empty) public GraphQL API. 

I also fixed authentication issues by replacing [sha2](https://crates.io/crates/sha2) with [bcrypt](https://crates.io/crates/bcrypt). This library is better suited to password hashing and verification than sha2 was. 

## Next Week

I would like to finish integrating diesel into at least one part of the project. (Preferably get user authentication and login working.) If I have extra time, it would be good to work on the project page and user pages.

## Blockers

None currently.
